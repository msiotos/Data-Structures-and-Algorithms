## Data Structures and Algorithms Assignments
This repository contains two programming assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the Technical University of Crete.

### Assignment 1:

Focus: Comparison of different list implementations (dynamically allocated, array-based, sorted, unsorted) in terms of insertion, deletion, and search performance.
Tasks: Implement six list variations, conduct experimental measurements, analyze time and space complexity, and discuss the results.

### Assignment 2:

Focus: Comparison of search data structures (AVL trees, BST trees, B-trees, linear hashing) in main memory and disk-based scenarios.
Tasks: Implement search functionality, measure insertion and search times, analyze access patterns, and discuss the trade-offs between different structures.

#### Note: 
Detailed instructions, requirements, and evaluation criteria for each assignment are provided in the respective assignment documents within this repository.

#### Grades:
Assignment 1: 10/10\
Assignment 2: 8.8/10
